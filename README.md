# Trinkets2Gold

## Developed by Dorien, Habib, Kyle

## The theory
* Creating two types of NFTs 
  * Trinket NFT
  * Gold NFT




### Concurrency Options:
#### Batch UTXO

* This design depends on some sort of off-chain checker to run the script to smelt the Trinket into Gold
* * It reduces cost with less UTXOs as well as data

#### Parallel UTXO
